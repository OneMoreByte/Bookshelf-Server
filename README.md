# Bookshelf-Server

This is the repository for my "Bookshelf Server", or my ultra small STX NAS case.

I have a [build log here](../log.md) if that's interesting to you otherwise if you want to try to make your own, I have a BOM and all the STLs needed in a [zip file in releases](https://github.com/OneMoreByte/Bookshelf-Server/releases). All of the cad files are fusion 360 or inventor files, so if you'd like to modify the files in any way they are available. The code I used to have the front panel communicate with the server is in a separate repository [(which can be found here)](https://github.com/OneMoreByte/io-sync). Built versions are also in zip file.


#BOM

Additionally, you'll need (or have access to) a drill with , a 3d printer that can fit the STLs, a metal file

(More stuff as I find out I need it)
